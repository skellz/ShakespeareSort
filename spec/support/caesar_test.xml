        <LINE>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</LINE>
        <LINE>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</LINE>
        <LINE>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</LINE>
        <LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>
        <LINE>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, sir, a carpenter.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</LINE>
        <LINE>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</LINE>
        <LINE>You, sir, what trade are you?</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>
          Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
        </LINE>
        <LINE>as you would say, a cobbler.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</LINE>
        <LINE>
          conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
        </LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>

        </LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</LINE>
        <LINE>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>
          What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, sir, cobble you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</LINE>
        <LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
        <LINE>
          matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
        </LINE>
        <LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
        <LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>
        <LINE>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</LINE>
